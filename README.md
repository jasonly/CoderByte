CoderByte
=========

07.12.14 - Oh I guess I should add a readme. My attempt at solving CoderByte problems in JavaScript. I'm new at this, so I'm going to try to fully comment these. If anyone has questions or a better solution please let me know! I'm always down to see different perspectives.

08.13.14 - Had my interview at Hack Reactor a few days ago, the waiting game sucks. The interviewer suggested I try out some of the medium problems. Going to give them a shot. ┬──┬◡ﾉ(° -°ﾉ)
